# Technical Test for 5IG Solutions

## Task 1 - Database Design for Library Management System

Inside the `task_1` folder you will find:

- `model.md`: Contains the entities and relationships I established for Task 1.
- `model.drawio`: Diagram created using the tool [draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/)
- `model.drawio.png`: Image of the entity-relationship diagram.
- `library_schema.sql`: SQL statements to initialize the database in SQLite.

## Task 2 - Working with REST APIs

Inside the `task_2` folder you will find:

- `README.md`: Brief documentation on how to initialize and run the APIs from the terminal. Both GET and POST methods were implemented using the [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) service. This task was completed using Python.

## Task 3 - Front-End Development Challenge

Inside the `task_3` folder you will find:

- `README.md`: Instructions on how to run the project locally.
- For this task, I used the following technologies: **Vite**, **React**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.
- I used the [Pok√©mon API](https://pokeapi.co/) for this task, since the use of a specific API was not restricted.
- The project is also deployed using **Vercel** as the hosting provider. [View Project](https://technical-tests-5ig.vercel.app/)
